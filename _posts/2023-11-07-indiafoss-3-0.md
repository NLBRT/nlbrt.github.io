As you might have guessed from the title of this post, today I'll be talking about my experience @ IndiaFOSS 3.0 (_formerly IndiaOS_), which was organised this year at the [NIMHANS Convention Centre](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/12.94314/77.59678). Now some of you might be wondering, what did I, an average Joe from some suburb in West Bengal, have anything to do with a Convention on "FOSS" (for the dummies, Free Open-Source Software)?

Well, _clears throat_ allow me to introduce to you...
